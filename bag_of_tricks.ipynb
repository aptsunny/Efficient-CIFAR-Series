    "In the [final post of the series](https://myrtle.ai/how-to-train-your-resnet-8-bag-of-tricks/) we come full circle, speeding up our single-GPU training implementation to take on a field of multi-GPU competitors. Whilst we've been otherwise occupied - investigating [hyperparameter tuning](https://myrtle.ai/learn/how-to-train-your-resnet-5-hyperparameters/), [weight decay](https://myrtle.ai/learn/how-to-train-your-resnet-6-weight-decay/) and [batch norm](https://myrtle.ai/learn/how-to-train-your-resnet-7-batch-norm/) - our entry for training CIFAR10 to 94% test accuracy has slipped five (!) places on the DAWNBench leaderboard:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1MzB0-FR_oIPVe9PCffvRI9DB13m2YI21)\n",
    "\n",
    "The top six entries all use 9-layer ResNets which are cousins - or twins - of the network we developed  [earlier in the series](https://myrtle.ai/learn/how-to-train-your-resnet-4-architecture/). First place is a 4-GPU implementation from Kakao Brain which completes in an impressive 37s. The single-GPU version of the same comes in third with 68s, an apparent 7s improvement over our single-GPU entry from last year, although close inspection shows that these submissions are using test-time augmentation (TTA). We shall discuss the validity of this approach towards the end of the post (our conclusion is that any reasonable restriction should be based on total inference cost and that the form of mild TTA used here, along with a lightweight network, passes on that front.) Note that our earlier submission, allowing the same TTA, would achieve a time of 60s on a 19 epoch training schedule without further changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of the post our single-GPU implementation surpasses the top multi-GPU times comfortably, reclaiming the coveted DAWNBench crown with a time of 34s and achieving a 10× improvement over the single-GPU state-of-the-art at the start of the series! Using the same TTA employed by the Kakao Brain submission, this drops to 26s. We achieve these times by accumulating a series of small (typically 0.1-0.3% in absolute test accuracy) improvements, which can be traded for shorter training times. These improvements are based on a collection of standard and not-so-standard tricks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our main weapon is statistical significance. The standard deviation in test accuracy for a single training run is roughly 0.15% and when comparing between two runs we need to multiply this by $\\sqrt{2}$. This is larger than many of the effects that we are measuring. Given that training times soon drop below a minute, we can afford to run experiments 10s-100s of times to make sure that improvements are real and this allows us to make consistent progress.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharp experimental results are essential to advancing the field but if a baseline is poorly-tuned or the number of runs too few, experimental validation holds little value. The main goal of today's post is to provide a well-tuned baseline on which to test novel techniques, allowing one to complete a statistically significant number of training runs within minutes on a single GPU. We confirm, at the end of the post, that improvements in training speed translate into improvements in final accuarcy if training is allowed to proceed towards convergence.\n",

    "Not bad! We've reduced the preprocessing time to about half a second. Actual preprocessing now takes a negligible amount of time and the bulk of time is spent transferring data back to the CPU. This is a bit silly, since the data will need to cross to the GPU again after batching and augmentation, incurring a further delay at each training step. Can we remove this by doing data augmentation on the GPU?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is yes, but it requires a little care. If we naively apply augmentation to individual training examples, as on the CPU, we will incur substantial overhead launching multiple GPU kernels to process each item. We can avoid this by applying the same augmentation to groups of examples and we can preserve randomness by shuffling the data beforehand.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider applying 8×8 cutout augmentation to CIFAR10 images. There are 625 possible 8×8 cutout regions in a  32×32 image, so we can achieve random augmentation by shuffling the dataset and splitting into 625 groups, one for each of the possible cutout regions. If we choose evenly-sized groups, this is not quite the same as making a random choice for each example (which leads to irregular group sizes) but it's close enough. As a further optimisation, if the number of groups for an augmentation becomes too large, we can consider capping it at a reasonable limit - say 200 randomly selected groups per epoch.\n",

    "This is great! We're able to iterate through 24 epochs of training data, applying data augmentation and shuffling in less than the time taken to transfer the dataset once to the CPU! Moreover, since we're no longer racing CPU preprocessing queues against the GPU, we can stop worrying about dataloading altogether, even if training gets faster. Note: we are relying on the fact that the dataset is small enough to store and manipulate as a whole in GPU memory, but a more sophisticated implementation could work around this - or one could switch to an industrial strength solution such as [Nvidia DALI](https://github.com/NVIDIA/DALI).\n",

We can restore the previous accuracy by adding an extra epoch to training. This is the only time in the post that we select an 'improvement' that leads to worse accuracy! The 5s gain from a more efficient network more than compensates the 2.5s loss from the extra training epoch. The net effect brings our time to 64s, up to third place on the leaderboard."

    "[Label smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00567) is a well-established trick for improving the training speed and generalization of neural nets in classification problems. It involves blending the one-hot target probabilities with a uniform distribution over class labels inside the cross entropy loss. This helps to stabilise the output distribution and prevents the network from making overconfident predictions which might inhibit further training. Let's give it a try - the label smoothing parameter of 0.2 has been very roughly hand-optimised but the result is not too sensitive to a range of choices."

In addition to smoothing, CELU applies an x- and y-shift to ReLU as shown below, but these are largely irrelevant given our use of batch norm."

It isn't supported directly in PyTorch but we can roll our own easily enough."

    "Batch norm standardises the mean and variance of each channel but is followed by a learnable scale and bias. Our batch norm layers are succeeded by ReLUs, so the learnable biases could allow the network to optimise the level of sparsity per channel. On the other hand, if channel scales vary substantially this might reduce the effective number of channels and introduce a bottleneck. Let's have a look at the dynamics of these parameters during training:"

Let's try freezing these at a constant value of $1/4$ - roughly their average at the midpoint of training. The learnable scale for the final layer is somewhat larger but we can adjust the scaling of the network output to compensate. \n",

We prefer to do things this way since it makes the impact of the channel scales on the learning rate dynamics of the biases more explicit."

    "Batch norm does a good job at controlling distributions of individual channels but doesn't tackle covariance between channels and pixels. Controlling the covariance at internal layers, using a 'whitening' version of batch norm, might be helpful but would entail extra computation as well as non-trivial implementation effort. We are going to focus on the easier problem at the input layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The classic way to remove input correlations is to perform global PCA (or ZCA) whitening. We propose a patch-based approach which is agnostic to the total image size and more in keeping with the structure of a conv net. We are going to apply PCA whitening to 3×3 patches of inputs as an initial 3×3 convolution with fixed (non-learnable) weights. We will follow this with a learnable 1×1 convolution. The 27 input channels to this layer are a transformed version of the original 3×3×3 input patches whose covariance matrix is approximately the identity, which should make optimisation easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let's plot the leading eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of 3×3 patches of the input data. The numbers in brackets are the square root of the corresponding eigenvalues to show the relative scales of variation along these directions and we plot the eigenvector with both signs to illustrate the direction of variation. As we might expect, variations in local brightness dominate.\n"

On the other hand, learning rates need to be annealed towards the end of training to enable optimisation along the steeper and noisier directions in parameter space. Parameter averaging methods allow training to continue at a higher rate whilst potentially approaching minima along noisy or oscillatory directions by averaging over multiple iterates. \n",

For efficiency reasons we update the moving average every 5 batches since we find that more frequent updates don't improve things.

For the learning rate, a simple choice is to stick with the piecewise linear schedule that we've been using throughout, floored at a low fixed value for the last 2 epochs and we choose a momentum of 0.99 so that averaging takes place over a timescale of roughly the last epoch.\n",

    "Suppose that you'd like your network to classify images the same way under horizontal flips of the input. One possibility, that we've been using till now, is to present the network with a large amount of data, possibly augmented by label preserving left-right flips, and hope that the network will eventually learn the invariance through extensive training. \n",
    "\n",
    "A second approach, which doesn't leave things to chance, is to present both the input image and its horizontally flipped version and come to a consensus by averaging network outputs for the two versions, thus guaranteeing invariance. This eminently sensible approach goes by the name of test-time augmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "At training time, we still present the network with a single version of each image - potentially subject to random flipping as a data augmentation so that different versions are presented on different training epochs. An alternative, would be to use the same procedure at training time as at test time and present each image along with its mirror. In this case, we could claim to have changed the network by splitting into two identical branches, one of which sees the flipped image, and then merging at the end. Through this lens, the original training can be viewed as a stochastic training procedure for a weight-tied, two branch network in which a single branch is 'dropped-out' for each training example.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dropout-training viewpoint makes it clear that any attempt to introduce a rule disallowing TTA from a benchmark is going to be fraught with difficulties. From this point of view, we have just introduced a larger network for which we have an efficient stochastic training methodology. On the other hand, if we don't limit the amount of work that we are prepared to do at test time then there are some obvious degenerate solutions in which training takes as little time as is required to store the dataset!\n",
    "\n",
    "These arguments are not only relevant to artificial benchmarks but also to end use-cases. In some applications, classification accuracy is all that is desired and in that case TTA should most definitely be used. In other cases, inference time is also a constraint and a sensible approach is to maximise accuracy subject to such constraints. This is probably a good approach for training benchmarks too. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case at hand, the Kakao Brain team has applied the simple form of TTA described here - presenting an image and its left-right mirror at inference time, thus doubling the computational load. More extensive forms of TTA are of course possible for other symmetries (such as translational symmetry, variations in brightness/colour etc.) but these would come at a higher computational cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now because these entries are based of a computationally light 9-layer ResNet _total inference time including TTA_ is likely to be much lower for these entries than for some of the 100+ layer networks that have been entered at earlier stages of the competition! According to our discussion above, any reasonable rule to limit this kind of approach should be based on inference time constraints and not an arbitrary feature of the implementation and so from this point-of-view, we should accept the approach.\n",

    "Despite the lack of tuning of the various extra hyperparameters of the final training setup for longer runs, it appears to maintain a healthy lead over the baseline even out to 100 epochs of training and approximate convergence.

We could presumably go quite a bit higher with proper hyperparameter optimisation. \n",

Note that we have made almost no attempt to optimise the 96% time and we would expect it to come down considerably from here."

I hope that the reader will find this useful in their work and believe that training times have a long way to fall yet (or accuracies improve if that's your thing!) through further algorithmic developments.\n",

    "At the outset of the series I half joked that if we could achieve 100% compute efficiency, training should take 40s. I would have been surprised to find that target surpassed by the end of the series with compute efficiency little better than it ever was! There is much scope for improvement on that front as well."
